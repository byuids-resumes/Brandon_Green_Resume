One thing I would recomment doing is to (if possible) add some other experience under Other Experience, like a society you participated or a personal project you worked on.
In the Pop Zero, maybe shrink the number of bullets you have, by removing some of them that are less important, like the last bullet for example, although it is good to show the employer that you worked many hours, it might be a little too much.
It is good to have here in GitHub, but the mission should be the next thing you remove from your resume, because it doesn't show any professional experiences, and the employer might think that you will be "annoying" about your religion.
